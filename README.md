# Store-layout-optimizer
 
Proof of work of the methods and metrics, introduced in my bachelor work

## How to create or open layout
Just open [store-editor.html](https://github.com/rKorniets/Store-layout-optimizator/blob/main/ui/template/store-editor.html) in any browser. There you can create your own layout and export it. Or preview any other layout from the repo

## View experiments and results
Check corresponding notebooks, some of them are duplicated to show the results for bigger and smaller stores.
